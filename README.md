<h2> Hi, I’m @k-atej! 👋 </h2>

I recently graduated with a B.A. in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology and Computer Science. I'm generally interested in building simple computational tools for use in research labs. I'm currently working on a open-source, standard workflow for the processing of single molecule FRET data. See my work [here.](https://github.com/k-atej/smFRET)

👩‍🔬 Starting in August, I will be working as a research technician in a research lab at Washington University in St. Louis! [Check them out!](https://www.vermalab.org/)
